Existing disaster management systems often struggle with timely response and resource optimization. To address these challenges, we propose integrating GeoRescue, an AI/ML-based disaster relief solution. By leveraging satellite imagery, real-time data analysis, historical insights, and social media monitoring, GeoRescue aims to predict, respond to, and recover from disasters efficiently. 
This approach represents a significant advancement in disaster management, enhancing predictive capabilities and minimising disaster impact. Social media monitoring, specifically through Twitter, provides real-time updates and insights from affected communities.
GeoRescue includes visual aids such as flood water level graphs, real-time seismic wave monitoring for earthquakes, and intensity graphs for tsunamis. It also utilises YouTube videos to educate society on effective disaster management strategies.
The resource allocation chatbot ensures prompt response to emerging needs by informing authorities and allocating resources accordingly
Our disaster assessment tool streamlines management by swiftly evaluating damage severity using pre and post-disaster imagery. This enables efficient resource allocation based on the severity of damage, optimally allocating response efforts. Risk mitigation helps identify high-risk areas and potential hazards post-disaster, aiding in the implementation of preventive measures to mitigate future risks.
It identifies high-risk areas post-disaster, enabling proactive risk mitigation measures. With data-driven insights, decision-makers can make informed choices, enhancing resource management and response planning.
